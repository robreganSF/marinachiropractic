        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Prior to becoming a Chiropractor she taught Physical Education and Biology classes at her old High School in Stratford Ontario. Dr. Neely’s interest in Chiropractic first began as a patient while a young athlete in competitive figure skating, volleyball, tennis and other sports. She credits Chiropractic with keeping her off the sidelines throughout her athletic career.

        <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Dr. Neely naturally gravitated to the practice, as did two of her brothers — one who practices in Canada, and another in Hong Kong. She continues to promote health through exercise, proper nutrition and an active lifestyle, and still enjoys participating in several sports.
